About I am a gardener and writer, and this is my travelogue. It also includes miscellaneous notes, mainly to myself.

A lot of this travelogue is written retrospectively, so I may be a year or so out in places. I wasn’t the best cataloguer of photos. And, I should warn, it will take me a while to catch up. You will also have to excuse the fact that some of the posts appear to have predated the Internet. That’s why I have included an ‘Updated’ field for the posts. It gives you a more accurate idea of when the post was written, as opposed to when the journey took place, which is given by the ‘date’ field.

Some – most of it – also happened before we had such things as digital cameras and phones; instead we had cameras and physical photo albums. I held on to my cameras even after the advent of the iPhone, and still mostly relied upon them for a while till I gave up because of the inconvenience of lugging a camera around. And the fact that I never trusted that this little thing in my hand would ever give good enough results. How wrong was I?

We have spent most of our time in North America and Europe, with a few other places thrown in just for good measure. Initially, many of our travels included my daughter and our parents. But our parents have either passed away or have grown too old; my daughter is old enough to do her own thing and has kicked off her visits to far-flung desinations with a trip to the Azores.
